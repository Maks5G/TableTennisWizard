The question of how long a set lasts in table tennis is probably the most discussed. The very word "set" is
not quite suitable for table tennis, it is more correct to say game. The thing is that before September 1,
2001 a game was played to 21 points. Many people have it in their memory that it was necessary to play big
games. Now, in table tennis, a game is played to 11 points.

1) The game is played to 11 points.

2) If a table tennis match is set at 10-10, the game is played to a 2-point advantage for one of the players.

3) After each game the players change sides.
