There is only one main rule concerning the warm-up of the players before the meet. The warm-up should
take no more than 2 minutes, after which the referee stops it and opens the meeting. But there is a
number of unspoken, and at the same time important rules, which will immediately show you the level of
your opponent, and he accordingly yours:

1) Always start with rolls to the right (forehand), after feeling the ball players move to topspins.
One sets up, the other shoots. Then they switch.

2) Subsequently, the players move to the rolling to the left (backhand), if one of the opponents played long or
medium spikes, he just sets the ball smooth overlay.

3) Trims are not played in warm-ups. Serving and game moments are not practiced.
Players try to hold the ball longer, do not shoot the ball at full speed.

4) Important! Do not show your full potential and secrets, especially if you play with spikes. Warm-up is needed
to feel how the ball flies, what bounce off the table, for many it is an opportunity to calm the nerves.
