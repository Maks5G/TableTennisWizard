Statistically, it is at pitches that most mistakes are made. After all, every company serves differently, and
everyone tries to establish their own rules. For example such absurdities: you cannot serve more than twice,
the ball can be served from the hand. Many do not even know how many consecutive serves in table tennis a
player serves.

Basic table tennis serving rules:

1) Each player serves only 2 serves in a row, not 5 as many people think, then the serves go to the opponent.

2) The ball should be thrown to a height of at least 16 cm when serving.

3) Hold the ball before the toss should be on an open palm, cover the ball with a racket or other parts of the
body is prohibited!

4) Serving the ball is performed in front of the table, which means that the throw of the ball and the moment of
hitting the racket on the ball must take place in front of the table, not beyond the line of the table.

5) If the ball touches the net or its bracket and hits the opponent's side, the service shall be over served.
If the ball touches the net, then hits the lower bracket of the net at the table and falls to the floor, such a
service is lost. Since the bracket does not belong to the playing surface of the table.

6) You can and must re-serve as many times as the number of times in a row the ball touched the net and hit
the side of the opponent. The number of overshots is not limited!
