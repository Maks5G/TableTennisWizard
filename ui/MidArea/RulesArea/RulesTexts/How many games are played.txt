Each competition rules set a different number of games in a meeting. As a rule, play up to 3 wins out of 5
games.

In our tournaments and competitions we are guided by the following rules:

1) A tournament involves a preliminary stage - at this stage we play to 2 wins.

2) Every final of a commercial tournament is played to 3 wins.

3) Regular league tournaments of the club are played on a circular system, each meeting continues until 3 wins.

4) If the score on parties is equal (for example: 2-2), then after gained 5 points in the final party players switch
sides. It does not matter if it is 5-0 or 5-4. There is no further change of sides.
