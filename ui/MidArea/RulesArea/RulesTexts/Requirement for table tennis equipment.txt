The most minimal requirements for the equipment:

1) You may only hit the ball with a racket that has a red overlay on one side and a black overlay on the other.
If, in large company, a friend brings a green racket from a sports store, and he is the strongest player, you
can safely tell him that you will not play, because the tennis racket does not meet the requirements.

2) Only a white or orange ball is allowed to play and it must be marked ITTF. If your friends unexpectedly
began to beat you with a ball from your local hypermarket, you have an ironclad excuse - the ball is the
wrong system.
