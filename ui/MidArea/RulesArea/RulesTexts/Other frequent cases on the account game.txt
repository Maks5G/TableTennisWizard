1) Touching the table with your hands is prohibited. Allowed only in rare cases, if the touch occurred with the
hand in which there is a racket

2) In table tennis there are no "dry" and "youth" games, always play to 11, even if the opponent could not earn
a single point. Although, as a rule, athletes do not allow this and give the so-called "mercy point". It is
considered a bad tone to win 11-0.

3) It is also customary in table tennis to apologize for the so-called "snot", it is enough to raise your hand.

4) In our club, because of the small size of the playground, a rule was introduced, in which the ball is replayed
if an extraneous, interfering object appeared in the playing area.

5) Balls are not replayed! Only in the case described above or at breakage of the ball. Wrong to serve, to serve
another must know the ball is not replayed!

6) Hit the edge of the table, "snot" - is not always good, there are times when the ball, bending around the net,
hits the side of the table or metal fixture and flew down, such a point will not be counted!
In other words, the ball flying from above counts, flying from the side - not always.
