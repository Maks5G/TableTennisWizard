To play table tennis, you will need a room or space that meets certain requirements. Here are some of the
basic requirements for a table tennis room:

Size: The room or space should be at least 14m long, 7m wide, and 5m high to provide adequate playing space
and clearance.

Lighting: The room should have lighting that provides even illumination over the playing area, with no
shadows or glare.

Flooring: The flooring should be smooth, level, and non-slip, with a consistent bounce. Flooring materials
commonly used for table tennis include hardwood, rubber, or synthetic materials specifically designed for
table tennis.

Walls: The walls should be light-colored and non-reflective, to provide good visibility of the ball.
If possible, the walls should be at least 1m away from the playing surface to prevent interference with play.

Climate control: The room should have adequate climate control to maintain a consistent temperature and
humidity level, which can affect the ball's bounce and players' grip.

It's important to note that these requirements are for optimal playing conditions, and recreational players
may have different preferences for their playing environment. However, having a room or space that meets
these standards can help ensure a comfortable and enjoyable playing experience.
