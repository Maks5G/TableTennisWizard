To play table tennis, you will need a racket (also known as a paddle or bat) that meets certain requirements.
The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) has specific rules and regulations for rackets used in
official competitions. Here are some of the basic requirements for a table tennis racket:

Size: The racket must be flat and rigid, with a blade that is at least 85% natural wood. The blade must be no
more than 6.35mm thick and 152.5mm wide.

Rubber: The rubber covering the blade must be red on one side and black on the other. The rubber must be
ITTF-approved and have a thickness of no more than 2.0mm.

Weight: The racket must weigh no more than 100g, including the blade and rubber.

Shape: The blade can be any shape, but the paddle as a whole must be rectangular and have a length of no
more than 400mm and a width of no more than 300mm.

Other features: The racket can have other features such as a handle, but it must not have any electronic or
mechanical parts that change the shape, size, or properties of the blade or rubber.

It's important to note that these requirements are for official competitions, and recreational players may
have different preferences for their rackets.
