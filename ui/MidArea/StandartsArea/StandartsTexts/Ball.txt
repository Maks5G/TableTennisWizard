To play table tennis, you will need a ball that meets certain requirements.
The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) has specific rules and regulations for balls used in
official competitions. Here are some of the basic requirements for a table tennis ball:

Size: The ball must have a diameter of 40mm.

Weight: The ball must weigh 2.7g to 2.8g.

Color: The ball must be white or orange, with a matte finish.

Bounce: When a standard table tennis ball is dropped from a height of 30cm onto a standard table tennis
surface, it must bounce up to a height of at least 24cm but not more than 26cm.

Material: The ball must be made of celluloid or a similar plastic material approved by the ITTF.

It's important to note that these requirements are for official competitions, and recreational players
may have different preferences for their balls. However, using a ball that meets these standards can
ensure a consistent and fair playing experience.
