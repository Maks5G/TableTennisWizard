To play table tennis, you will need a table that meets certain requirements.
The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) has specific rules and regulations for tables used in official
competitions. Here are some of the basic requirements for a table tennis table:

Dimensions: The table must be 2.74m long, 1.525m wide, and 0.76m high. The playing surface must be a rectangle
with a length-to-width ratio of 2:1.

Surface: The playing surface of the table must be made of a uniformly dark-colored material, typically green or
blue, with a matte finish. The surface must be flat and horizontal, with a white line 2cm wide along each edge.

Net: The net must be 15.25cm high and extend the full width of the table. It should be suspended by a cord
attached at each end to a post, which must be 15.25cm tall and situated at the edge of the table.

Ball bounce: When a standard table tennis ball is dropped from a height of 30cm onto the surface of the table,
it must bounce up to a height of at least 23cm.

Other features: The table should have legs that are firmly attached and do not obstruct the players' movement.
It should also have a frame that supports the playing surface and keeps it level.

It's important to note that these requirements are for official competitions, and recreational players may have
different preferences for their tables. However, having a table that meets these standards can ensure a
consistent and fair playing experience.
