The Left Axe serve is another popular technique in table tennis that can add a left side spin to the ball.

It is executed in a similar manner to the Right Axe serve, with the main difference being that the player
uses the opposite side of the racket.

To perform the Left Axe serve, the player tosses the ball into the air and swings the racket in a motion
similar to the Right Axe serve, but this time using the opposite side of the racket.

This imparts a left side spin to the ball, which can make it difficult for the opponent to return.

Like the Right Axe serve, the Left Axe serve requires practice and precision to master.

Experienced players can use this serve to keep their opponents off-balance and set up favorable positions
for their next shot.

It's important to note that while the Axe serves can be effective, they should not be overused.

Opponents can quickly catch on to a player's serving patterns, making it easier for them to anticipate and
return the ball.

Therefore, it's essential to mix up serves and vary the spin and placement to keep opponents guessing and
on their toes.
