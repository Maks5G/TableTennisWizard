This type is not very difficult to master, but is very helpful to the amateur throughout his tennis career.

The fact is that you can serve different lengths and different spins on the left with almost one motion.

That is, you can serve from the same position both short to the right and long fast to the left.

This combination is extremely unpleasant for all table tennis players.

And the most unpleasant for reception in table tennis are serves with the right side-up and side-down to
the right corner.

It is very uncomfortable to put the right slant under them and at the slightest technical defect either
an error occurs or the ball rises high and is convenient to complete the serving attack.

And, as you have already guessed, it is the serve from the left side that is served with a right side-top
and side-bottom rotation.

A clarification must be made here. When you spin the ball from left to right, the ball is given what is
called right lateral rotation. When you spin the ball from right to left, you give the ball a left side spin.

When you serve from the left, we move from left to right and give the ball a right lateral spin accordingly.
