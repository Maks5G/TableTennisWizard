In this variation, the racket moves from right to left and the ball is given a left lateral rotation.

It is not easy to serve this type at once. That's why I offer a 3-step training scheme.

In step 1, you simply learn how to spin the ball. For example, you stand at home by the couch and over and
over again reproduce the motion of the serve so that you get a spin.

At this step, the main thing is to learn how to spin the ball.

In step 2, you learn the correct position from which to perform the "pendulum".

Having taken the correct position, you just learn to guide the ball on the table without rotation.

It is not needed yet - here the main thing to master the correct position and the synchronized work of the
legs and hands.

On the 3rd step you combine these 2 skills (spinning the ball and serving from the correct position) and after
a few drills you have a pretty good 'pendulum' with side rotation.

Then I recommend not to stop and go further - to master more complicated variants of the "pendulum": short
serves with side-to-bottom and side-to-top rotation, as well as a variant of pure bottom rotation and flat serve.
