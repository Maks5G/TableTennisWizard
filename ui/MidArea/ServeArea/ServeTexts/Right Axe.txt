The axe serve is a popular serve in table tennis due to its effectiveness in adding spin to the ball.

The rotation created by the serve can make it difficult for the opponent to return the ball, giving the server
an advantage in the game.

To execute the axe serve, the player tosses the ball into the air and swings the racket in a motion similar to
that of an axe chopping wood.

The racket strikes the side of the ball, imparting a right side-up spin to the ball.

The player then squats down at the end of the serve, ready for the opponent's return.

While the axe serve may be one of the first serves that beginners learn in table tennis, it can still be a
valuable weapon for more experienced players.

With practice, players can develop the ability to vary the spin and placement of the serve, making it even more
challenging for their opponents to return the ball.
