The fan serve, also known as the windshield wiper serve, is a unique technique in table tennis that was first
introduced in the Soviet Union.

While it's not as widely used today, it was popular during the '70s and '80s, and some coaches still teach it
to students.

To perform the fan serve, the player tosses the ball high into the air and strikes it with a sweeping motion,
as if they are wiping a windshield.

This creates a side spin on the ball that can be difficult for opponents to anticipate and return.

Similar to the Axe serves, the fan serve also requires the player to squat down when serving.

This adds more power and spin to the serve, making it even more challenging for the opponent to return.

While the fan serve can be effective, it's also a high-risk serve that requires a lot of skill and practice
to execute properly.

If the serve is not performed correctly, it can result in a fault or an easy point for the opponent.

In the end, the fan serve may not be as popular as it once was, but it's still a valuable technique for
players looking to add variety and unpredictability to their serves.
